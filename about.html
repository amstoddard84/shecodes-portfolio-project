            <h2 class="mb-4">A Content Developer, Strategist, & Storyteller based in Atlanta, GA.</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
                â€‹I'm a copywriter and and digital strategist with a background in publishing, storytelling, brand development, client
                engagement, retention strategy and product marketing. I have over a decade of combined experience with promotions, email
                communications, client education, and user engagement for SaaS products, as well as for the literary and broadcasting
                industries. In addition, I'm a USA TODAY bestselling author of fiction with over ten years of experience in publishing and literary
                marketing. I've been a featured speaker on panels for writing, publishing, and social media
                marketing at events such as Killer Nashville, DragonCon, and the Decatur Book Festival.
                <br><br>
                Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and dog, reading, experiencing live music, camping, hiking,
                coffee, hockey (Go Caps!), and college football (Go Dawgs!).
