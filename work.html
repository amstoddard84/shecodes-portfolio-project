            <p>I designed responsive email templates for several of <i>Newsweek's</i> email subscription offerings, including 
            The Starting 5, Road to Recovery, and STEM Informer. In spring and summer of 2020, I provided content strategy 
        and audience engagement consultation for these newsletters and helped increase The Starting 5's CTR by 9.52%</p>

        for 87 sweepstakes featured on websites owned by CNN, Newsweek, Cumulus, iHeart, American General Media, Radio One, and many other US broadcasters.</p>

            <p>
                I've had the pleasure of serving as a freelance literary marketing assistant for Lucinda Literary, LLC and their 
                robust roster of notable authors, including Richard Cohen, Ginny Gilder, Douglas Kennedy, Juliana Barbassa, 
                Nina Darnton, and Anna Lefler. I designed and optimized social media campaigns, email newsletter templates,
                and provided creative marketing consultation. A Twitter campaign I launched for Richard Cohen in 2016 increased 
                his follower engagement by over 90%.
